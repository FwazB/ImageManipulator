## About

Pixel Sorter is a TypeScript-based tool that applies a glitch effect to images by sorting pixels based on their brightness. This project demonstrates basic image manipulation using the `canvas` library in Node.js.

## Features

- Loads an image and processes it pixel by pixel.
- Sorts pixels by brightness to create a glitch effect.
- Saves the modified image to a specified output path.
- Utilizes the `canvas` library for image manipulation.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-sorter.git

Ensure you have an input image named `input_image.png` in the project directory, or modify the script to point to your desired image file.
